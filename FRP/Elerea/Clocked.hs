This version differs from the simple one in adding associated freeze
control signals (\'clocks\') to stateful entities to be able to pause
entire subnetworks without having to write all the low-level logic
explicitly.  The clocks are fixed to signals upon their creation, and
the 'withClock' function can be used to specify the common clock for
the signals created in a given generator.

A clock signal affects 'delay' elements the following way: if the
clock signal is true, the delay works as usual, otherwise it remembers
its current output and throws away its current input.  If we consider
signals to be functions of time (natural numbers), the behaviour of
delay can be described by the following function:

> delay x0 s (t_start,clk) t_sample
>   | t_start == t_sample = x0
>   | t_start < t_sample  = if clk t_sample
>                             then s (t_sample-1)
>                             else delay x0 s t_start s_clock (t_sample-1)
>   | otherwise           = error "stream doesn't exist yet"

A simple example to create counters operating at different rates using
the same generator:

> divisibleBy n x = x `mod` n == 0
>
> counter = stateful 0 (+1)
>
> drift = do
>   time <- counter
>   c1 <- withClock (divisibleBy 2 <$> time) counter
>   c2 <- withClock (divisibleBy 3 <$> time) counter
>   return ((,) <$> c1 <*> c2)

Note that if you want to slow down the drift system defined above, the
naive approach might lead to surprising results:

> slowDrift = do
>   time <- counter
>   withClock (divisibleBy 2 <$> time) drift

The problem is that the clocks are also slowed down, and their spikes
double in length.  This may or may not be what you want.  To overcome
this problem, we can define a clock oblivious edge detector to be used
within the definition of @drift@:

> edge = withClock (pure True) . transfer False (\b b' -> b && not b')
>
> drift = do
>   time <- counter
>   t2 <- edge (divisibleBy 2 <$> time)
>   t3 <- edge (divisibleBy 3 <$> time)
>   c1 <- withClock t2 counter
>   c2 <- withClock t3 counter
>   return ((,) <$> c1 <*> c2)

This works because the 'withClock' function overrides any clock
imposed on the generator from outside.

-- | A signal represents a value changing over time.  It can be

-- Signals and the values they carry are denoted the following way in
-- the documentation:
--
-- > s = <<s0 s1 s2 ...>>
--
-- This says that @s@ is a signal that reads @s0@ during the first
-- sampling, @s1@ during the second and so on.  You can also think of
-- @s@ as the following function:
--
-- > s t_sample = [s0,s1,s2,...] !! t_sample

-- Signals are constrained to be sampled sequentially, there is no
-- random access.  The only way to observe their output is through
-- 'start'.

-- | A signal generator is the only source of stateful signals.  It

-- signals.  It exposes the 'MonadFix' interface, which makes it
-- possible to define signals in terms of each other.  Unlike the
-- simple variant, the denotation of signal generators differs from
-- that of signals.  We will use the following notation for
-- generators:
--
-- > g = <|g0 g1 g2 ...|>
--
-- Just like signals, generators behave as functions of time, but they
-- can also refer to the clock signal:
--
-- > g t_start s_clock = [g0,g1,g2,...] !! t_start

{- $effectful

The following combinators are primarily aimed at library implementors
who wish build abstractions to effectful libraries on top of Elerea.

-}

-- | An IO action executed in the 'SignalGen' monad. Can be used as
-- `liftIO`.
execute :: IO a -> SignalGen a
execute act = SG $ \_ _ -> act

-- | A signal that executes a given IO action once at every sampling.
--
-- In essence, this combinator provides cooperative multitasking
-- capabilities, and its primary purpose is to assist library writers
-- in wrapping effectful APIs as conceptually pure signals.  If there
-- are several effectful signals in the system, their order of
-- execution is undefined and should not be relied on.
--
-- Example:
--
-- > do
-- >     smp <- start $ do
-- >         ref <- execute $ newIORef 0
-- >         effectful $ do
-- >             x <- readIORef ref
-- >             putStrLn $ "Count: " ++ show x
-- >             writeIORef ref $! x+1
-- >             return ()
-- >     replicateM_ 5 smp
--
-- Output:
--
-- > Count: 0
-- > Count: 1
-- > Count: 2
-- > Count: 3
-- > Count: 4
--
-- Another example (requires mersenne-random):
--
-- > do
-- >     smp <- start $ effectful $ return randomIO :: IO (IO Double)
-- >     res <- replicateM 5 smp
-- >     print res
--
-- Output:
--
