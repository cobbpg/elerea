-- | A signal represents a value changing over time.  It can be
-- thought of as a function of type @Nat -> a@, where the argument is
-- the sampling time, and the 'Monad' instance agrees with the
-- intuition (bind corresponds to extracting the current sample).
-- Signals and the values they carry are denoted the following way in
-- the documentation:
--
-- > s = <<s0 s1 s2 ...>>
--
-- This says that @s@ is a signal that reads @s0@ during the first
-- sampling, @s1@ during the second and so on.  You can also think of
-- @s@ as the following function:
--
-- > s t_sample = [s0,s1,s2,...] !! t_sample
--
-- Signals are constrained to be sampled sequentially, there is no
-- random access.  The only way to observe their output is through
-- 'start'.
newtype Signal a = S (IO a) deriving (Functor, Applicative, Monad)

-- | A dynamic set of actions to update a network without breaking
-- consistency.
type UpdatePool = [Weak (IO (), IO ())]

-- | A signal generator is the only source of stateful signals.  It
-- can be thought of as a function of type @Nat -> a@, where the
-- result is an arbitrary data structure that can potentially contain
-- new signals, and the argument is the creation time of these new
-- signals.  It exposes the 'MonadFix' interface, which makes it
-- possible to define signals in terms of each other.  The denotation
-- of signal generators happens to be the same as that of signals, but
-- this partly accidental (it does not hold in the other variants), so
-- we will use a separate notation for generators:
--
-- > g = <|g0 g1 g2 ...|>
--
-- Just like signals, generators behave as functions of time:
--
-- > g t_start = [g0,g1,g2,...] !! t_start
--
-- The conceptual difference between the two notions is that signals
-- are passed a sampling time, while generators expect a start time
-- that will be the creation time of all the freshly generated
-- signals in the resulting structure.

-- | Embedding a signal into an 'IO' environment.  Repeated calls to
-- the computation returned cause the whole network to be updated, and

-- | The 'delay' combinator is the elementary building block for

-- | A reactive signal that takes the value to output from a signal

-- create new signals in the monad, which is the key to defining
-- dynamic data-flow networks.

-- | A signal that is true exactly once: the first time the input
-- signal is true.  Afterwards, it is constantly false, and it holds

-- of the input is constantly @False@):
--
-- > until <<False False True True False True ...>> =
-- >     <| <<False False True  False False False False False False False ...>>
-- >        << ---  False True  False False False False False False False ...>>

-- >        << ---   ---   ---   ---   ---   ---  False False False False ...>>
-- >        ...
-- >     |>
--

--
-- > until s = do
-- >     step <- transfer False (||) s
-- >     dstep <- delay False step
-- >     memo (liftA2 (/=) step dstep)

-- | A signal that can be directly fed through the sink function
-- returned.  This can be used to attach the network to the outer
-- world.  The signal always yields the value last written to the
-- sink.  In other words, if the sink is written less frequently than
-- the network sampled, the output remains the same during several
-- samples.  If values are pushed in the sink more frequently, only
-- the last one before sampling is visible on the output.
--
-- Example:
--
-- > do
-- >     (sig,snk) <- external 4
-- >     smp <- start (return sig)
-- >     r1 <- smp
-- >     r2 <- smp
-- >     snk 7
-- >     r3 <- smp
-- >     snk 9
-- >     snk 2
-- >     r4 <- smp
-- >     print [r1,r2,r3,r4]
--
-- Output:
--
-- > [4,4,7,2]

external x = do
  ref <- newIORef x
  return (S (readIORef ref), writeIORef ref)

-- | An event-like signal that can be fed through the sink function
-- returned.  The signal carries a list of values fed in since the
-- last sampling, i.e. it is constantly @[]@ if the sink is never
-- invoked.  The order of elements is reversed, so the last value
-- passed to the sink is the head of the list.  Note that unlike
-- 'external' this function only returns a generator to be used within
-- the expression constructing the top-level stream, and this
-- generator can only be used once.
--
-- Example:
--
-- > do
-- >     (gen,snk) <- externalMulti
-- >     smp <- start gen
-- >     r1 <- smp
-- >     snk 7
-- >     r2 <- smp
-- >     r3 <- smp
-- >     snk 9
-- >     snk 2
-- >     r4 <- smp
-- >     print [r1,r2,r3,r4]
--

{- $example

For a not entirely trivial example, let's create a dynamic collection
of countdown timers, where each expired timer is removed from the
collection.  First of all, we'll need a simple tester function:

@
 sigtest gen = 'replicateM' 15 '=<<' 'start' gen
@

We can try it with a trivial example:

@
 \> sigtest $ 'stateful' 2 (+3)
 [2,5,8,11,14,17,20,23,26,29,32,35,38,41,44,47]
@

Our first definition will be a signal representing a simple named
timer:

@
 countdown :: String -\> Int -\> SignalGen (Signal (String,Maybe Int))
 countdown name t = do
   let tick prev = do { t \<- prev ; 'guard' (t \> 0) ; 'return' (t-1) }
   timer \<- 'stateful' (Just t) tick
   'return' ((,) name '<$>' timer)
@

Let's see if it works:

@
 \> sigtest $ countdown \"foo\" 4
 [(\"foo\",Just 4),(\"foo\",Just 3),(\"foo\",Just 2),(\"foo\",Just 1),(\"foo\",Just 0),
  (\"foo\",Nothing),(\"foo\",Nothing),(\"foo\",Nothing),...]
@

Next, we will define a timer source that takes a list of timer names,
starting values and start times and creates a signal that delivers the
list of new timers at every point:

@
 timerSource :: [(String, Int, Int)] -\> SignalGen (Signal [Signal (String, Maybe Int)])
 timerSource ts = do
   let gen t = 'mapM' ('uncurry' countdown) newTimers
           where newTimers = [(n,v) | (n,v,st) \<- ts, st == t]
   cnt \<- 'stateful' 0 (+1)
   'generator' (gen '<$>' cnt)
@

Now we need to encapsulate the timer source signal in another signal
expression that takes care of maintaining the list of live timers.
Since working with dynamic collections is a recurring task, let's
define a generic combinator that maintains a dynamic list of signals
given a source and a test that tells from the output of each signal
whether it should be kept.  We can use @mdo@ expressions (a variant of
@do@ expressions allowing forward references) as syntactic sugar for
'mfix' to make life easier:

@
 collection :: Signal [Signal a] -\> (a -\> Bool) -\> SignalGen (Signal [a])
 collection source isAlive = mdo
   sig \<- 'delay' [] ('map' 'snd' '<$>' collWithVals')
   coll \<- 'memo' ('liftA2' (++) source sig)
   let collWithVals = 'zip' '<$>' ('sequence' '=<<' coll) '<*>' coll
   collWithVals' \<- 'memo' ('filter' (isAlive . 'fst') '<$>' collWithVals)
   'return' $ 'map' 'fst' '<$>' collWithVals'
@

We need recursion to define the @coll@ signal as a delayed version of
its continuation, which does not contain signals that need to be
removed in the current sample.  At every point of time the running
collection is concatenated with the source.  We define @collWithVals@,
which simply pairs up every signal with its current output.  The
output is obtained by extracting the current value of the signal
container and sampling each element with 'sequence'.  We can then
derive @collWithVals'@, which contains only the signals that must be
kept for the next round along with their output.  Both @coll@ and
@collWithVals'@ have to be memoised, because they are used more than
once (the program would work without that, but it would recalculate
both signals each time they are used).  By throwing out the respective
parts, we can get both the final output and the collection for the
next step (@coll'@).

Now we can easily finish the original task:

@
 timers :: [(String, Int, Int)] -\> SignalGen (Signal [(String, Int)])
 timers timerData = do
   src \<- timerSource timerData
   getOutput '<$>' collection src ('isJust' . 'snd')
     where getOutput = 'fmap' ('map' (\\(name,Just val) -> (name,val)))
@

As a test, we can start four timers: /a/ at t=0 with value 3, /b/ and
/c/ at t=1 with values 5 and 3, and /d/ at t=3 with value 4:

@
 \> sigtest $ timers [(\"a\",3,0),(\"b\",5,1),(\"c\",3,1),(\"d\",4,3)]
 [[(\"a\",3)],[(\"b\",5),(\"c\",3),(\"a\",2)],[(\"b\",4),(\"c\",2),(\"a\",1)],
  [(\"d\",4),(\"b\",3),(\"c\",1),(\"a\",0)],[(\"d\",3),(\"b\",2),(\"c\",0)],
  [(\"d\",2),(\"b\",1)],[(\"d\",1),(\"b\",0)],[(\"d\",0)],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]]
@

If the noise of the applicative lifting operators feels annoying, she
(<http://personal.cis.strath.ac.uk/~conor/pub/she/>) comes to the
save.  Among other features it provides idiom brackets, which can
substitute the explicit lifting.  For instance, it allows us to define
@collection@ this way:

@
 collection :: Stream [Stream a] -> (a -> Bool) -> StreamGen (Stream [a])
 collection source isAlive = mdo
   sig \<- 'delay' [] (|'map' ~'snd' collWithVals'|)
   coll \<- 'memo' (|source ++ sig|)
   collWithVals' \<- 'memo' (|'filter' ~(isAlive . 'fst') (|'zip' ('sequence' '=<<' coll) coll|)|)
   'return' (|'map' ~'fst' collWithVals'|)
@
